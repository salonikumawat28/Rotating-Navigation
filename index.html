            <p>It all started in 2013 when a good friend of mine introduced me to web development. We started learning HTML, and quickly after I got into CSS, at that point I was mind blown by it's power!

                A few months later, I created a Freelancer account and started bidding on different jobs there. Some of the clients liked my work so I got myself few long-time gigs.
                
                I started learning jQuery to enhance my "web powers", but after a while, realizing that jQuery is built on top of JavaScript, I dropped it and started learning Vanilla JS, and when I felt that I understood what is going on under the hood, I picked ReactJS to help me on the long run on the front-end. I also added NodeJS (back-end) to my skills palette so I could provide Full-Stack JavaScript services. :)
                
                I later switched to Upwork as they seem to care more about their freelancers.
                
                I also love creating tutorials on various topics ranging from: how to create different Web Components or Web Applications to how to solve Coding Challenges (mostly in JavaScript). You can find out more about these on my blog.</p>
